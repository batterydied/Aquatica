# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

When constructing a home aquarium, there are many parts that must be purchased, from tanks and filters, to rocks and decoration, to fish and plants. Although many aquarium owners use aquatic supply stores and pet stores for this purpose, those outlets do not have features allowing users to directly compare products and prices from different sellers or to resell their aquarium supplies to other enthusiasts.

## Proposed Solution

Our application, **Aquatica**, would provide a centralized marketplace for aquarium lovers and aquarium supply sellers to connect and engage in commerce. We would provide the following features:

- **Customizable Accounts**: Users can sign for a seller account, a buyer account, or both. Seller accounts have access to a store interface where they can list items, set prices, and view their earnings, while buyer accounts have access to a search page where they can find sellers who are offering the items they want. Moreover, buyers can use filter to find products based on criteria such as price, brand and other preferences. Once they find an item they want, they have the option to add it to the shopping cart or send direct messages to the seller for more details about the product. 

- **Price Comparison**: The app will allow buyers to compare the prices of different sellers' products to help inform their purchase decisions. The app will also prioritize displaying discounted items to ensure that buyers can easily spot and buy items in a lower price during promitional periods.

- **Direct Messages**: Buyers can message sellers directly to negotiate or ask questions about their products. Sellers can message buyers directly to ask feedback once buyer received their products. Sellers can also send direct messages about new items and discounted products to the buyers.

## Why This Matters

By creating this app, we would make having a home aquarium more convenient and approachable. We would also allow aquarium lovers to know more about where their components come from, promoting safety and awareness. Additionally, through the price comparison feature and community interaction, we can increase the transparency of the aquarium product market, helping users better understand the origin and quality of the products they choose, thereby enhancing their sense of security and awareness of aquatic ecosystem protection.
