# Problem Statement

## Problem Description

When constructing a home aquarium, there are many parts that must be purchased, from tanks and filters, to rocks and decoration, to fish and plants. Although many aquarium owners use aquatic supply stores and pet stores for this purpose, those outlets do not have features allowing users to directly compare products and prices from different sellers or to resell their aquarium supplies to other enthusiasts.

## Proposed Solution

Our application, **Aquatica**, would provide a centralized marketplace for aquarium lovers and aquarium supply sellers to connect and engage in commerce. We would provide the following features:

- **Customizable Accounts**: Users can sign for a seller account, a buyer account, or both. Seller accounts have access to a store interface where they can list items, set prices, and view their earnings, while buyer accounts have access to a search page where they can find sellers who are offering the items they want.

- **Price Comparison**: The app will allow buyers to compare the prices of different sellers' products to help inform their purchase decisions.

- **Direct Messages**: Buyers can message sellers directly to negotiate or ask questions about their products.

## Why This Matters

By creating this app, we would make having a home aquarium more convenient and approachable. We would also allow aquarium lovers to know more about where their components come from, promoting safety and awareness.
